# W9NAA EchoLink Node (Rose-Hulman Inst. of Tech. ECE597 Project)

This repository will serve as the development location for my ECE597 project. The final product will be the EchoLink node for W9NAA, the school HAM radio club.

Credit goes to ON1ARF for development of the original linkbox software (the original source code has been forked and placed in the "thelinkbox" folder).
